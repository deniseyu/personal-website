I am happy for you to use them in your conference talks, event info pages, open source projects,

connected to where it is posted!

You do not have to seek my permission for each usage, but if you want, tag me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/deniseyu21)
because I'm curious about how people are using them :-D
